# UML Diagram for Graduation Project

This project contains the UML diagram for my graduation project. The UML diagram provides a visual representation of the system's structure and behavior. It helps in understanding the relationships between different components and how they interact with each other.

The UML diagram includes various diagrams such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and more. These diagrams help in documenting the design and architecture of the system, making it easier to communicate and collaborate with other team members.

By referring to the UML diagram, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of the project's scope, requirements, and functionality. It serves as a blueprint for the development process and guides the implementation of the system.

Please refer to the UML diagram in this project for a comprehensive overview of my graduation project.
